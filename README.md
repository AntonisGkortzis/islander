# Islander - Greek islands for a Greek perspective

The purpose of this repository is to get familiar with the Git and Github's concepts and practice some basic commands.
The outcome will be published as an unofficial travel guide! [(Check last years' contributions)](http://www.tusharma.in/athens/taksidiotis-athens-travel-guide-by-the-greeks/)

**Important:** Please send your GitHub username to Antonis (if you have not shared it yet either in the lab or via email) so that you can contribute to this repository as a collaborator.

## Tasks
- Clone this repository
- Add interesting places (such as museum, bar, or restaurant), activity (walking tour, or food/wine-tasting tour), or anything interesting for a tourist to the ```guide.md``` file
- Contribute to at least 3 categories
- The important thing is – you, as a Greek, are recommending it
- You may change/modify text added by others
- Try to arrange the entries in categories (such as ‘Tour’, ‘Food’, ‘History’, 'Beaches')
- Commit your changes
- Push to the GitHub repository (if required pull and resolve merge conflicts)

**Deadline – 12:59 PM, Feb 27, 2019** 

## Tips
- Include links where necessary (i.e., locations, bars, etc.)
- You can include pictures, but don't forget to commit and push them. Pictures should be placed in the ```Photos/``` directory
- Rearrange text if you think that it should be organized different - refactorings are always welcome!

## Grading system
- Number of contributions - the more the better
- Completeness of each contribution. (one sentence contributions are 'bad' contributions)
- Breaking things have a penalty...
- Fixing others breaks have a bonus!
- Quality of commit messages - descriptive (of the change) and concise
