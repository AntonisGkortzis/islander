![](/images/cephalonia.jpg)

Cephalonia is the largest of the Ionian Islands. The sapphire waters of Cephalonia are steeped with history. Cephalonia is considered by many the home to Odysseus, the legendary king hailed in Homer’s The Odyssey. Fortunately, it won’t take you ten years to get there. Explore the enchanting caverns of the Drogarati caves, sail to Ithaca on a glass-bottomed boat or marvel at the ancient artifacts inside the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli, Cephalonia’s main town. Or just hide from it all at one of the island’s many private beach coves.

#### <a name="paxoiInfo"></a>Discover Paxoi
How about visiting the island that was first mentioned by the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets, Homer? Paxoi in Greek is actually in plural, due to the existence of an island chain including Antipaxoi (MUST visit!) which is located 5.5 miles far away from Paxoi. The central port of Paxoi is called Gaios, where you can find plenty of restaurants and cafeterias and enjoy the beautiful view.

Are you wondering how to get there? Every day, the ferry-boats of Igoumenitsa transfer a lot of tourists who aim to explore Paxoi. If you go to Igoumenitsa by car, bare in mind that you' d better use the new highway in order to "gain" time (2 hours). Unless you want to drive for 5 1/2 hours:frowning:!

#### <a name='antipaxoi'></a>Antipaxoi
**How to get to Antipaxoi?**: The easiest way to get to Antipaxoi is take a small boat :boat: from Gaios. The departure point of these boats is very easy to find-you just need to take a walk around Gaios! The first stop after you take the boat is an amazing beach you can see below :ocean:. If you are a fan of camping you can also try it in Antipaxoi.

**What else to see in Antipaxoi?**: After you finish your relaxing time at the beautiful beach of Antipaxoi you can retake the same small boat and visit the wonderful caves that are located in different spots around the island but are accessible only by boat. By the way, you can rent your own boat!

#### <a name='swimPaxoi'></a>Where to swim
Excpet for the beaches you can reach by boat, in order to reach the most remarkable ones (of course, all beaches are beautiful) you need to take the car or use the local means of transport. Here are some of the most beautiful beaches you can find in Paxoi and Antipaxoi:

* [Vrika Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d2061955-Reviews-Vrika_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
One of the most beautiful beaches which is located in the north part of Antipaxoi is called Vrika Beach. The light-blue and green water can be easily visible when approaching the beach with the boat. The almost white sand in combination with the landscape and the clear sea will impress you. It is a well-organized beach where you can rent an umbrella and/or sunbeds and enjoy the hot summer days.
* [Monodendri Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d7071058-Reviews-Monodendri_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
If you are looking for a non-organized beach, Monodendri is your solution. Though unorganized, you can lay on the sand, swim safely and at 7 p.m. you can enjoy the wonderful sunset. At a glance you may face some difficulties on accessing Monodendri Beach, but in reality it is not that difficult and it is absolutely worth making an effort to reach this beach.

#### <a name='foodPaxoi'></a>Where to eat
In order to get in real touch with the atmosphere of an island you need to taste the greek traditional food with a view to the sea during the sunset. Here is a list of restos you can find in the most beautiful spots of the island:

* [La Conchiglia](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g776011-d10449525-Reviews-La_Conchiglia-Loggos_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
It is a high-quality restaurant where you can try fresh seafood almost at the edge of the waves. You can also find most of the traditional greek dishes except for the seafood ones. It is necessary to mention that the products that the chefs use in La Conchiglia originate from the local trade, while the oil is produced by the restaurant's owner. Of course, you can call and make a reservation a few days ahead in order to make sure that you will enjoy your meal without waiting. For more contact info, please visit the link.

* [Akis Fish Bar Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1402870-d1860390-Reviews-Akis_Fish_Bar_Restaurant-Lakka_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
Akis Fish Bar & Restaurant located at the edge of the harbor of Lakka, is one of the best restaurants you will find on the island of Paxos. The courtyrad of the restaurant is basically the end of the harbor of Lakka, so we can say that cannot get any closer to the sea. Not to mention the view of the incredible coastline of Lakka, which offers one the most beautiful sunsets you will ever see. But we didn't mention anything about food! For people looking to eat lunch or dinner, the restaurant offers a quality range of choices containing mainly seafood. There is also a mediterranian menu, for the lovers of the mediterranian gastronomy. Central role to this, play the fresh seafood. Various meats are also offered to complete the menu.

* [La Vista](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g1402868-d12550993-Reviews-La_Vista-Gaios_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
You want a restaurant where you will find a very different concept from the conventional perception prevailing in the other restaurants? La Vista is your solution! The La Vista is a new restaurant, run by young people, who have more than a decade of work experince, making them knowledgable and good at what they do. At La Vist having ordered just someof their appetisers and salads you can have a great time and leave full and satisfied, without spending an arm and a leg in comparison with a lot of restos around in the island. The La Vista serves mainly seafood, while everyday there are different homemade "mum's" dishes (moussaka, lasagne, briam).

#### <a name="info_corfu"></a>History/Why Corfu?
Corfu is the second largest of the ionian islands. It has been a part of greek mythology many times but now it is mostly known for its aged venetian architecture. The name Kerkyra is a modern version but it is only used in Greece. Now why visit Corfu? Well if you are not intrigued by an island that has amazing beaches, mountains to climb, lush vegetation to give you all the green you want to see, traditions and nice cuisine then at least visit it to see a landmark protected by [UNESCO](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/978)

* [Porto Timoni](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g5485027-d8115796-Reviews-Porto_Timoni_Beach-Afionas_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html):After going down a mountain for about half an hour (which of course you will have to climb back up at the end but i promise you it is totally worth it) you will find yourself in the middle of two sand beaches. Now you might be wondering:thought_balloon: what does this mean exactly? Well it means that in just a few steps you can go from one beach to another. The view from above where you can actually see that it is two different parts, because once you are down due to the dense vegetation you cannot really see it, is mesmerizing. Nevertheless the feeling of just being there is unique.

It is located in the northernmost part of the island and it consists of magnificent formations of the ground which in many cases is clay creating a beautiful landscape that does not lack in green either. The road is a bit difficult so you will need a jeep or you can just walk down and arrive in a small beach where you can either enjoy the sun and do a spa with natural clay mask you can just pick up from the ground or the rocks or take a boat to the famous [Canal D'Amour](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g676295-d2469814-Reviews-Canal_D_Amour-Sidari_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html):heart: so you can enjoy the view on the way and possibly fall in love:heart_eyes: with the person you will swim with as the legend says.

#### <a name"visitcorfu"></a>When to visit?
If not in the summer when it is best for almost all islands then i would recommend Orthodox Easter time. Corfu has some unique traditions that make it a very popular destination around this time so be prepared for a big crowd but it's worth it.Two of the rituals that stand out are Good Friday
when the epitaph processions which have different colours depeding on the church come out all intersect at the centre of town and Holy Saturday
when suddenly the mood changes within a few minutes from the mourning of the epitaph to the joy of the first Easter which here happens at 11:00 a.m in the morning of Saturday.Locals throw in the streets large clay pitchers filled with water from every balcony of the island while the church bells peal joyfully. After that the three marching bands come out again to parade around the town playing joyful music this time. You are not convinced yet? Make sure to check out the video below.

#### <a name="general_info_syros"></a>General Information
Syros is a Greek island and Ermoupoli is its capital, which is currently the capital of Cyclades. Syros flourished after the year of 1826 when refugees from Chios, Crete, Psara and Mikra Asia joined the island. Syros has been a naval, industrial and cultural center of the modern Greek nation. Syros consists of many settlements such as Ano Syros, Galissas, Kini, Foinikas, Ntelagratsia, Vari , Azolymnos and others. The island is widely known for its musical tradition as it has contributed to the Greek music history with the songs of Markos Vamvakaris and the musical myth that follows him. Syros, has been a "hot" destination for tourists throughout the years, but especially the last 3 years it has become the center of attention because of an athletic exhibition that is held in July (AegeanBall Festival).

#### <a name="beaches_syros"></a>Beaches
Posidonia, is a well organized beaches in Syros, located 13 km south west from Ermoupolis. It has a beautiful sandy coast and has highly recommended place to enjoy your coffee, or your food with the sight of this beautiful shore.  Agathopes is a small sandy beach close to Posidonia. It is a popular destination for tourist but mostly for family tranquil moments. Last but not least, my favorite place for a quick dive is Asteria beach which is actually a dock where you can perform dives but also admire the beautiful architectural achievements due to being very close to the center of Ermoupolis.

#### <a name="cityhall_syros"></a>Ermoupolis City Hall
The beautiful city hall of ermoupolis is placed in Miaouli square. It has a magnificent architectural design that combines both classic ancient Greece and romanticism of the West with it being characterized as a neoclassical one influenced by German an Italian architects. The city hall was completed in 1898 and was designed by Ernst Ziller. The central part is made entirely from marble. It hosts the Archaeological Museum of Syros, the Court of Law, the Land Registry, the Public Archives, and some other public services (source: www.greeka.com). The particular town hall is considered as one of the most beautiful amongst the Greek ones.

According to the myth, Pileas, the father of Achilles, was buried on Alonnisos. This is the reason why the island’s second name is "Achilliodromia".

![](./images/skiathos.jpg)

#### <a name="historyOfSkiathos"></a>History of Skiathos
In Ancient times, the island played a minor role during the Persian Wars. In 480 BC, the fleet of the Persian King Xerxes was hit by a storm and was badly damaged on the rocks of the Skiathos coast. Following this the Greek fleet blockaded the adjacent seas to prevent the Persians from invading the mainland and supplying provisions to the army facing the 300 Spartans defending the pass at Thermopylae. The Persian fleet was defeated there at Artemisium and finally destroyed at the Battle of Salamis a year later. Skiathos then became part of the Delian League. The city was destroyed by Philip V of Macedon in 200 BC.

In 1207 the Ghisi brothers captured the island and built the Bourtzi, a small Venetian-styled fortress similar to the Bourtzi in Nafplio, on an islet just out of Skiathos Town, to protect the capital from the pirates. But the Bourtzi was ineffective in protecting the population and in the mid-14th century the inhabitants moved the capital from the ancient site that lay where modern Skiathos Town is to Kastro (the Greek word for castle), located on a high rock, overlooking a steep cliff above the sea at the northernmost part of the island. Today, the ruins of Kastro are a tourist attraction.

In 1704 monks from Athos built the Evangelistria Monastery, which played a part on the Greek War of Independence as a hide-out for Greek rebels. The first flag of Greece was created and hoisted in the Evangelistria Monastery in Skiathos in 1807, where several prominent military leaders (including Theodoros Kolokotronis and Andreas Miaoulis) had gathered for consultation concerning an uprising, and they were sworn to this flag by the local bishop.

#### <a name="general_info_astypalaia"></a>General Information about Astypalaia
Astypalaia, widely known also as "Butterfly of the Aegean" because of it's butterfly like shape, is an island of the Dodecanese which is definitely worth visiting. If you have a glance at the map o Greece you will notice that Astypalaia island is exactly between the island chains of Dodecanese and Cyclades. This unique position makes Astypalaia an extraordinary cultural mixture of those two island chains and the culture that follows them. Astypalaia is an island that both Greek and foreign tourists prefer for peaceful and family moments during which you can relax both physically and mentally.

There are four basic settlements on the island. First of all, the capital of the island which is called Chora. This settlement is considered as one of the most beautiful of the islands of the aegean sea. The old port of the island which is settled in this area is called "Pera Gialos". On the top of the hill, stands the Castle of the island which provided safety to the citizens whenever pirates invaded the island and was built mainly from stone. The white houses on the hill of the island and the 8 traditional windmills made from stone are the distinctive signs of the island. Many years before, those windmills were used to serve the needs of the inhabitants. Secondly, Livadi is a settlement provided with both a fertile land and a golden sandy coast. This fertile land produces mandarins, lemons, oranges, vineyards and pomegranates. In Livadi you can find places to eat (fresh meat and fish etc.) and accommodate yourself. Thirdly, Maltezana is a settlement which probably took its name from Maltese pirates who used to stay in the area. Maltezana is a peaceful place to stay and has a little picturesque port with the small boats and the lied nets of the local fishermen. Those fishermen are the ones who provide fresh fish to the whole island. The last settlement is called Vathi which is mainly consisted of fields and does not have many inhabitants.

Pera Gialos is a beach located very close to the center of Chora and can be accessed very easily for a quick swim. Two beaches that are located far from the center of the island and are a bit difficult to reach are Kaminakia and Vatses but they are totally worth the visit. Plakes is not actually a beach but is consisted of many solid rocks and rocky surfaces making it a perfect place for the lovers of diving. Other worthy beaches of the island are Tzanakia, Agios Konstantinos, Tria Marmaria, Vathi, Analipsi and Mple Limanaki. All the beaches that were mentioned before, are not actually organized; the only organized beach of the island is Livadi. Daily boat tours are organized, with the destination of two small remote islands called Koutsomitis and Kounoupa. The colors of the sea there are truly magnificent to watch and enjoy.

#### <a name="gen-info-nisiros"></a>General Information
Nisyros is an island in the southern Aegean and one of the Dodecanese islands.
It belongs to the group of ancient southern Sporades, and is located northwest of Rhodes,
between Kos, Tilos and Astypalea. Specifically, it is 8 miles north west of Tilos, and 10 miles south
of Kos, to which it administratively belongs, and 9 nautical miles east of Cape Natsa, Turkey.
Nisyros has an area of ​​about 41 square kilometers and a total coastline of about 24 kilometers.

Its population in 1950 numbered 2,516 inhabitants. At the last census (2011), its population was
987 inhabitants. The capital of the island is Mandraki. Other villages of Nisyros are Emborios,
Paloi, Nikia and Loutra.

#### <a name="history-nisiros"></a>History
During the Persian wars, Nisyros, along with Kalymnos and Kos, were subject to the Kingdom of
Bodrum under Artemisia. Then he followed the fate of the rest of the islands. It seems that
colonists from the island founded Nisyros in Caria of Asia Minor. It was captured by the
Italians in 1912, who ruled the island until its annexation to Greece in 1948.

#### <a name="volcano-nisiros"></a>Volcano of Nisiros
Nisyros, along with Methana, Milos and Santorini, is among the active volcanoes of our country.
The oldest rocks of the island date back to 160,000 years while the newest (prehistoric) is
15,000 years old and cover the whole island.\


Polybotis is the largest crater in the volcano, with a diameter of 260m and a depth of 30m.
There are five other craters in the area, the largest of which is "Stefanos", with a diameter
of 30 meters and a depth of 30 meters. Also, the volcano surrounds a valley (caldera), with a
length of 2,400m and a width of 950m.


Estimations show that two explosions occurred 25,000 years ago.The volcano erupted in 1422,
and four centuries later, in 1872, the eruption of the volcano caused earthquakes. Ash
and other materials covered the ground of Rammus. The territory of the Lakki and Rammos
areas had been transformed into a lake with warm, salt water, overflowing with the crater.
The most recent strong explosion occurred in 1888. A cylindrical conduit of volcanic
 elements with a diameter of at least 25 meters was created.

#### <a name="gen-info-Rhodes"></a>General Information
Rhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese islands of Greece and is also the island group's historical capital. Administratively the island forms a separate municipality within the Rhodes regional unit, which is part of the South Aegean administrative region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Rhodes. The city of Rhodes had 50,636 inhabitants in 2011.
It is located northeast of Crete, southeast of Athens and just off the Anatolian coast of Turkey. Rhodes' nickname is The island of the Knights, named after the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem, who once conquered the land.

#### <a name="history-Rhodes"></a>History
In the 8th century BC, the island's settlements started to form, with the coming of the Dorians, who built the three important cities of Lindos, Ialyssos and Kameiros, which together with Kos, Cnidus and Halicarnassus (on the mainland) made up the so-called Dorian Hexapolis
(Greek for six cities).

In Pindar's ode, the island was said to be born of the union of Helios the sun god and the nymph Rhodos, and the cities were named for their three sons. The rhoda is a pink hibiscus, native to the island. Diodorus Siculus added that Actis, one of the sons of Helios and Rhode, travelled to Egypt. He built the city of Heliopolis and taught the Egyptians astrology.

In the second half of the 8th century, the sanctuary of Athena received votive gifts that are markers for cultural contacts: small ivories from the Near East and bronze objects from Syria. At Kameiros on the northwest coast, a former Bronze Age site, where the temple was founded in the 8th century, there is another notable contemporaneous sequence of carved ivory figurines. The cemeteries of Kameiros and Ialyssos yielded several exquisite exemplars of the Orientalizing Rhodian jewellery, dated in the 7th and early 6th centuries BC.Phoenician presence on the island at Ialysos is attested in traditions recorded much later by Rhodian historians.

#### <a name="archaeology-Rhodes"></a>Archaeology
The Colossus of Rhodes was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This giant bronze statue was documented as once standing at the harbour. It was completed in 280 BC and destroyed in an earthquake in 224 BC. No trace of the statue remains today.

Historical sites on the island of Rhodes include the Acropolis of Lindos, the Acropolis of Rhodes with the Temple of Pythian Apollo and an ancient theatre and stadium, ancient Ialysos, ancient Kamiros, the Governor's Palace, Rhodes Old Town (walled medieval city), the Palace of the Grand Masters, Kahal Shalom Synagogue in the Jewish Quarter, the Archeological Museum, the ruins of the castle of Monolithos, the castle of Kritinia, St. Catherine Hospice and Rhodes Footbridge.

#### <a name="nightlife-Rhodes"></a>Nightlife
On an island of contrasts, Rhodes’ nightlife can take you from lively and raucous to chilled and romantic in the space of a single evening. For sheer number and variety, Rhodes’ nightclubs are the places to be seen, while plentiful tavernas and eateries leave you spoilt for choice too. Here’s our guide to Rhodes’ four main locations and their evening hotspots.

<b>Faliraki:</b>
Rhodes nightlife doesn’t get better than this. Faliraki’s reputation as a 24-hour party town makes it the first stop for anyone looking to cut loose on this fascinating Greek island. With two strips of bars, clubs and restaurants to choose from, you can easily find a cosy restaurant corner, a sophisticated cocktail bar or a dance-till-dawn, strobe-lit club with resident DJ. Most people head to Bar Street for drinks before switching to Club Street for the best of Rhodes’ nightclubs around 1am.

Ziggy’s on Bar Street is cocktail heaven and the place where the fishbowl was invented, so a great spot for a group photo. Once on Club Street, the Matrix garden lets clubbers clear their heads or cool off, while the Bed Club has all the big name DJs in the summer months. But leave time for the famous Q Club for great tunes and dancing till 5am.

<b>Rhodes Town:</b>
Less crowded but endlessly lively and fascinating, nightlife in Rhodes Town is laid back and relaxed. Make a beeline for the popular Hippocrates Square in the medieval old town, where bars, tavernas and eateries surround a pretty fountain in the shadow of the palace.

You’ll love the centrally-located Ammoyiali Restaurant on Voriou Ipirou for its deliciously modern take on traditional Greek fare, while cocktails at Flaws Bar always means the best service in chicer than chic surroundings. Or, for a classic Greek taverna playing live, traditional music, head to Blue Lagoon and dance like the locals do.

<b>Pefkos and Lindos:</b>
Off the beaten track but adored by locals, the resorts of Lindos and Pefkos on the eastern shores of the island are both stunning and secluded. But don’t be fooled. While both villages are quiet and idyllic during daylight hours, they liven up considerably in the evening.

A surprise find in such a balmy location is Lindos Ice Bar on Krana Square. Partygoers seek out this refuge from the Grecian sunshine, donning big coats and huge smiles as they drink at an ice bar from glasses made from the same. The beats and light show are equally cool. Meanwhile, the Eclipse Bar in Pefkos attracts a young crowd with something for everyone, from pool and games to music and dancing, plus the only cliff-jumping waterfall in Greece.

Food-wise, you’ll find some stunning locations for watching the sunset, while enjoying a glass of local wine and the catch of the day. Try Philosophia Beach Taverna In Pefkos for romantic views of the bay and a chance to dip your toes in the water. In a similar vein is Dapapa on Kavos Beach, where the seafood is glorious with a backdrop to match. Ambrosia Restaurant in Lindos is sheer foodie heaven. Call in after a day exploring the acropolis, for a family-friendly atmosphere and seafood you’ll remember long after your tan fades.

Tilos is a small island near Rhodes. It is quiet, authentic with some untouched physical scenery and it will magnetize you from the first moment. The statues, caves and churches of the island will say a lot about its culture.
Tilos is also the first “green” island of the Mediterranean. It combines the wind and solar energy and saves it on special batteries. The total energy is estimated that will cover by far the energy needs of Tilos and there are plans in motion to transfer that energy under the sea to Kos.

Megalo Chorio (The Big Village) is the capital of the island and there it is worth visiting the museum in which you can find bones of dwarf elephants.
Those who love hiking will not be disappointed as there are several paths to go explore and admire the nature. You will also find several partridges but bear in mind that hunting is strongly prohibited.

Tilos is a pretty quiet island with only a few offerings for nightlife. One small bus starts picking people up at 23:00 (11:00pm) with direction to Mikro Chorio (Small Village). I can guarantee you that nobody is expecting what they are about to see. It is an abandoned and half-broken village which has been bombed and deserted by its inhabitants on the second World War. However, this village is becoming alive every night. Lighted by generators in a way that makes every house to have trembling lights giving off a magical vibe. The stars are countless, and the atmosphere is something nobody has experienced before. People start by just drinking a few drinks and end up dancing and singing all together until the morning when the small bus will get them down at the Megalo Chorio.

The journey to Kastellorizo is a very lengthy one, but the scene that will welcome the daring travellers is absolutely worth it. Colourful houses all over the place, their reflections shining through the crystal-clear waters. The scenery is amazing and magical. The island was destroyed by both world wars and was rebuilt again and again. Most of its old inhabitants migrated to Australia and now only 492 people live the whole year there.

The ruins of the Castle of the Knights are sitting above the small village at the hill of Kastell Roso from which the island was named. It is located next to Turkey and, therefore, many Turkish ships are visiting all the time.
You will definitely not need a car as you can go everywhere by foot.
It is worth mentioning that a very small airport exists in the island that makes the access to the island a bit easier, but the flights are very few.

* If you visit Kastellorizo you definitely cannot miss visiting Ro (or Rho). You will go to that tiny island with a boat and see the statue of Despoina Achladioti, also known as Madam of Ro (Rho) who for so many years every day she would raise the Greek flag to show that this small and tiny island still belonged to Greece

You can reach the cave with a small boat; the opening is really small and sometimes you can’t even see it. The tourists get in a very small boat and then they lie down so they can go through the opening. But then they come across one of the most magical images and sceneries they have ever encountered. Stalactites in combination with the water and the sunlight create a turquoise and green scenery that will mesmerize you and you will definitely remember it for your whole life.

Its castle is what differentiate it and it is the first thing that every visitor sees as it is built on the highest hill; it is Molivos’ Acropolis. The castle has undergone many repairs both inside and outside, but it is still standing, and it is worth going to the top. There you will enjoy the breath-taking view and you can admire the amazing sunset, which for some unknown reason at least to me, takes shades of purple.

#### <a name="history_aegina"></a>Some History
Aegina dates back to 20th century BC, meaning that it has a large historical background to offer. At first, the island was a site of trade for people living in Attica and the Peloponnesus. Throughout the history, Aegina passed through a lot of wars and rivalries, especially with Athens. However, it was dominated by many different tribes, such as the Macedonians, the Achaeans etc. During the Byzantine period, Aegina belonged to the East Roman Empire in 395. The island flourished during the early 9th century, as evidenced by church construction activity, but suffered greatly from Arab raids originating from Crete. The first devastating hit for the island took place in 1654 during the Ottoman Empire. Almost 2 centuries later, during the Greek War of Independence, Aegina became an administrative centre for the Greek revolutionary authorities. That period, Ioannis Kapodistrias was briefly established on the island.

#### <a name="why_aegina"></a>Why Aegina?
Aegina belongs to the Saronic Gulf, a part of sea which is surrounded be Attica's urban area. All the islands of the Saronic gulf-Aegina, Salamis, Poros- are very close destinations for just a day-trip as the port of Piraeus, Athen's port, lies on the northeastern edge of the gulf. In combination with the beauty that Aegina offers, if you just came in Athens for a couple of days, don't hesitate to go to Piraeus, buy a ferry-boat ticket and travel to Aegina.

In the autumn you can experience the most spectacular sunsets when the sun sets behind the island of Moni.

#### <a name="discoverSalamina"></a>Discover Salamina
It’s not a famous island like Mykonos, Crete or Santorini.
It’s even kept out of the loop when compared to its sister Saronic islands like Aegina, Agistri or Hydra.
That’s because, as I found out, Salamina is not the kind of island destination that requires a lot of planning.

* Poros Clock Tower

Visitors to the picturesque island of Poros identify it with its landmark, the Clock Tower. This clock tower was built in 1927 and is an imposing feature. It is definitely a bit of a climb from the waterfront being the highest point of the island, but when you reach it, the view from there is breathtaking and worth the effort. The clock tower also attracts a number of photographers for the view it offers, the coming together of land, water and sky.

## <a name="evia_island"></a>Evia
The island of Evia is one of the closest to Athens and yet it is one of the most unknown. That is because Evia is so large that there is much to know about it. Second in size to Crete, it stretches from the tip of the Pelion Peninsula all the way south to the coast of Attika. It's southern tip is just a short distance from the Cycladic islands of Andros and Kea though unfortunately there is no ferry connection. If there were, more tourists would come here. As it is, because it is so close to the mainland that you can drive to it, Evia has been and remains a popular summer holiday destination for Greeks and Greek-Americans, Canadians, Australians and others whose families originally came from the island.The topography of the island is as varied as anywhere in Greece, with sparkling Aegean beaches and coves on its east coast, a mountainous interior with rivers, streams and forests, a west coast that is a mix of beaches, the city of Halkida, large towns, industry, agriculture, beaches and wetlands. And in the northwest the town of Edipsos is the most popular spa in Greece, with hot water gushing from rocks and crevices into the sea and pools of the many hotels and healing centers.There are several ways to reach Evia from Athens. Which way you choose depends on where in Evia you want to go, because as I said; Evia is a very large island and a very long one. How large and long? From one tip to the other could take you four or five hours by car.  You could drive almost to Thessaloniki from Athens in that time. Of course much of the journey will be on narrow winding roads where there is a good possibility that you will be stuck behind a big slow moving truck with nowhere to pass for at least part of the journey. And most likely you will stop to wade in the cool waters of the Kirea river that runs alongside the road that goes north from the modern city of Halkida to the fishing village of Limni, the spas of Edipsos and the beautiful beaches of the northern coast.

## <a name="crete_island"></a>Crete
Of all the Greek islands, Crete is one of the most distinctive and beautiful. Our guide lists great places to stay (from campsites to boutique hotels), the best tavernas and the island’s must sees.It is the largest Greek island, has the most diverse mix of landscapes, and stands far to the south of most of the rest of the country. Bits of it are reminiscent of other parts of Greece, but on the whole it stands alone and has its own unmistakeable culture and atmosphere.The north coast of the island is the most populated area, and most well known to tourists. Heraklion (or Iraklion) is the island’s capital and main entry point. A working city, it can be off-putting at first, but it has a world-class museum. Rethymnon and Hania to the west are much more pleasant and retain a distinct Venetian influence. To the east Agios Nikolaos, or Ag Nik to Brits, is one of the island’s major resort, but still retains some character.

The interior is home to the White Mountains, which soar to over 2,000m in the western part of the island, and offer some spectacular hikes and drives. The mountains are a bit more gentle to the east, and in their midst they hide the extraordinary basin of the Lasithi plateau dotted with white windmills.The south coast is much more rugged and less visited than the north. It is crisscrossed with gorges and dotted with isolated villages and coves. It is also the stepping off point for the isolated islets to the south of Crete.

The last thing that makes Crete stand out from the other islands is the breadth of its history: from the mysterious Minoans with their labyrinthine palaces, through Venetian control, to the daring deeds during the German occupation.
