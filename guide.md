#### <a name="paxoiInfo"></a>Discover Paxoi
How about visiting the island that was first mentioned by the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets, Homer? Paxoi in Greek is actually in plural, due to the existence of an island chain including Antipaxoi (MUST visit!) which is located 5.5 miles far away from Paxoi. The central port of Paxoi is called Gaios, where you can find plenty of restaurants and cafeterias and enjoy the beautiful view.

Are you wondering how to get there? Every day, the ferry-boats of Igoumenitsa transfer a lot of tourists who aim to explore Paxoi. If you go to Igoumenitsa by car, bare in mind that you' d better use the new highway in order to "gain" time (2 hours). Unless you want to drive for 5 1/2 hours:frowning:!

#### <a name='swimPaxoi'></a>Where to swim
Excpet for the beaches you can reach by boat, in order to reach the most remarkable ones (of course, all beaches are beautiful) you need to take the car or use the local means of transport. Here are some of the most beautiful beaches you can find in Paxoi and Antipaxoi:
