#### <a name="info_cephalonia"></a>Some History
![](/images/cephalonia.jpg)
Cephalonia is the largest of the Ionian Islands. The sapphire waters of Cephalonia are steeped with history. Cephalonia is considered by many the home to Odysseus, the legendary king hailed in Homer‚Äôs The Odyssey. Fortunately, it won‚Äôt take you ten years to get there. Explore the enchanting caverns of the Drogarati caves, sail to Ithaca on a glass-bottomed boat or marvel at the ancient artifacts inside the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli, Cephalonia‚Äôs main town. Or just hide from it all at one of the island‚Äôs many private beach coves.

#### <a name="paxoiInfo"></a>Discover Paxoi
How about visiting the island that was first mentioned by the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets, Homer? Paxoi in Greek is actually in plural, due to the existence of an island chain including Antipaxoi (MUST visit!) which is located 5.5 miles far away from Paxoi. The central port of Paxoi is called Gaios, where you can find plenty of restaurants and cafeterias and enjoy the beautiful view.

Are you wondering how to get there? Every day, the ferry-boats of Igoumenitsa transfer a lot of tourists who aim to explore Paxoi. If you go to Igoumenitsa by car, bare in mind that you' d better use the new highway in order to "gain" time (2 hours). Unless you want to drive for 5 1/2 hours:frowning:!

#### <a name='antipaxoi'></a>Antipaxoi
**How to get to Antipaxoi?**: The easiest way to get to Antipaxoi is take a small boat :boat: from Gaios. The departure point of these boats is very easy to find-you just need to take a walk around Gaios! The first stop after you take the boat is an amazing beach you can see below :ocean:. If you are a fan of camping you can also try it in Antipaxoi. ![](/images/Antipaxoi.jpg)

**What else to see in Antipaxoi?**: After you finish your relaxing time at the beautiful beach of Antipaxoi you can retake the same small boat and visit the wonderful caves that are located in different spots around the island but are accessible only by boat. By the way, you can rent your own boat! ![](/images/antipaxoi-blue-caves-cruise.jpg)

#### <a name='swimPaxoi'></a>Where to swim
Excpet for the beaches you can reach by boat, in order to reach the most remarkable ones (of course, all beaches are beautiful) you need to take the car or use the local means of transport. Here are some of the most beautiful beaches you can find in Paxoi and Antipaxoi:

* [Vrika Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d2061955-Reviews-Vrika_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
One of the most beautiful beaches which is located in the north part of Antipaxoi is called Vrika Beach. The light-blue and green water can be easily visible when approaching the beach with the boat. The almost white sand in combination with the landscape and the clear sea will impress you. It is a well-organized beach where you can rent an umbrella and/or sunbeds and enjoy the hot summer days.
* [Monodendri Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d7071058-Reviews-Monodendri_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
If you are looking for a non-organized beach, Monodendri is your solution. Though unorganized, you can lay on the sand, swim safely and at 7 p.m. you can enjoy the wonderful sunset. At a glance you may face some difficulties on accessing Monodendri Beach, but in reality it is not that difficult and it is absolutely worth making an effort to reach this beach.

#### <a name='foodPaxoi'></a>Where to eat
In order to get in real touch with the atmosphere of an island you need to taste the greek traditional food with a view to the sea during the sunset. Here is a list of restos you can find in the most beautiful spots of the island:

* [La Conchiglia](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g776011-d10449525-Reviews-La_Conchiglia-Loggos_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
It is a high-quality restaurant where you can try fresh seafood almost at the edge of the waves. You can also find most of the traditional greek dishes except for the seafood ones. It is necessary to mention that the products that the chefs use in La Conchiglia originate from the local trade, while the oil is produced by the restaurant's owner. Of course, you can call and make a reservation a few days ahead in order to make sure that you will enjoy your meal without waiting. For more contact info, please visit the link.

* [Akis Fish Bar Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1402870-d1860390-Reviews-Akis_Fish_Bar_Restaurant-Lakka_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
Akis Fish Bar & Restaurant located at the edge of the harbor of Lakka, is one of the best restaurants you will find on the island of Paxos. The courtyrad of the restaurant is basically the end of the harbor of Lakka, so we can say that cannot get any closer to the sea. Not to mention the view of the incredible coastline of Lakka, which offers one the most beautiful sunsets you will ever see. But we didn't mention anything about food! For people looking to eat lunch or dinner, the restaurant offers a quality range of choices containing mainly seafood. There is also a mediterranian menu, for the lovers of the mediterranian gastronomy. Central role to this, play the fresh seafood. Various meats are also offered to complete the menu.

* [La Vista](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g1402868-d12550993-Reviews-La_Vista-Gaios_Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
You want a restaurant where you will find a very different concept from the conventional perception prevailing in the other restaurants? La Vista is your solution! The La Vista is a new restaurant, run by young people, who have more than a decade of work experince, making them knowledgable and good at what they do. At La Vist having ordered just someof their appetisers and salads you can have a great time and leave full and satisfied, without spending an arm and a leg in comparison with a lot of restos around in the island. The La Vista serves mainly seafood, while everyday there are different homemade "mum's" dishes (moussaka, lasagne, briam).

#### <a name="general_info_astypalaia"></a>General Information about Astypalaia
Astypalaia, widely known also as "Butterfly of the Aegean" because of it's butterfly like shape, is an island of the Dodecanese which is definitely worth visiting. If you have a glance at the map o Greece you will notice that Astypalaia island is exactly between the island chains of Dodecanese and Cyclades. This unique position makes Astypalaia an extraordinary cultural mixture of those two island chains and the culture that follows them. Astypalaia is an island that both Greek and foreign tourists prefer for peaceful and family moments during which you can relax both physically and mentally.

There are four basic settlements on the island. First of all, the capital of the island which is called Chora. This settlement is considered as one of the most beautiful of the islands of the aegean sea. The old port of the island which is settled in this area is called "Pera Gialos". On the top of the hill, stands the Castle of the island which provided safety to the citizens whenever pirates invaded the island and was built mainly from stone. The white houses on the hill of the island and the 8 traditional windmills made from stone are the distinctive signs of the island. Many years before, those windmills were used to serve the needs of the inhabitants. Secondly, Livadi is a settlement provided with both a fertile land and a golden sandy coast. This fertile land produces mandarins, lemons, oranges, vineyards and pomegranates. In Livadi you can find places to eat (fresh meat and fish etc.) and accommodate yourself. Thirdly, Maltezana is a settlement which probably took its name from Maltese pirates who used to stay in the area. Maltezana is a peaceful place to stay and has a little picturesque port with the small boats and the lied nets of the local fishermen. Those fishermen are the ones who provide fresh fish to the whole island. The last settlement is called Vathi which is mainly consisted of fields and does not have many inhabitants.

![](/images/windmills-astypalaia.jpg)

#### <a name="beaches_astypalaia"></a>Beaches of Astypalaia
In Astypalaia you can find both sandy coasts and rocky bays which can be characterized as "hidden treasures". Pera Gialos is a beach located very close to the center of Chora and can be accessed very easily for a quick swim. Two beaches that are located far from the center of the island and are a bit difficult to reach are Kaminakia and Vatses but they are totally worth the visit. Plakes is not actually a beach but is consisted of many solid rocks and rocky surfaces making it a perfect place for the lovers of diving. Other worthy beaches of the island are Tzanakia, Agios Konstantinos, Tria Marmaria, Vathi, Analipsi and Mple Limanaki. All the beaches that were mentioned before, are not actually organized; the only organized beach of the island is Livadi. Daily boat tours are organized, with the destination of two small remote islands called Koutsomitis and Kounoupa. The colors of the sea there are truly magnificent to watch and enjoy.

Friendly note: Kaminakia, Vatses, Pera Gialos and Mple Limanaki are the best ones.

![](/images/astypalaia-waters.jpg)

#### <a name="food_astypalaia"></a>Food of Astypalaia

In the island of Astypalaia you can find plenty types of fish, honey, cheese and meat. The best delicacies that you can find are Pougkia (a type of cheese pie with Kopanisti (spicy cheese) and honey), Lampriano (goat filled with rice and its liver) and many other local and greek tastes.

Friendly note: The best place to eat is a small "taverna" located on the beach of Steno which provides excellent tastes of local food, great service and lovely, kind personnel. It is the perfect place to eat, drink your coffee, and relax listening to the sound of the waves.

#### <a name="brief_note"></a>A brief note by a traveller..

Astypalaia is a great island for everyone who wants to enjoy the beauty and the tranquility of the nature. The island is known for having one of the best camping facilities among all the Greek islands. If you stay at the camping you can enjoy the musical nights that it provides but also attend the festivals that are held in August and are a landmark for all the inhabitants and the visitors of the island. The nature, the history and the unique architectural structure of the island make it a one of the most unique islands of the Aegean sea.

#### <a name="gen-info-nisiros"></a>General Information
Nisyros is an island in the southern Aegean and one of the Dodecanese islands.
It belongs to the group of ancient southern Sporades, and is located northwest of Rhodes,
between Kos, Tilos and Astypalea. Specifically, it is 8 miles north west of Tilos, and 10 miles south
of Kos, to which it administratively belongs, and 9 nautical miles east of Cape Natsa, Turkey.
Nisyros has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 41 square kilometers and a total coastline of about 24 kilometers.

Its population in 1950 numbered 2,516 inhabitants. At the last census (2011), its population was
987 inhabitants. The capital of the island is Mandraki. Other villages of Nisyros are Emborios,
Paloi, Nikia and Loutra.

#### <a name="history-nisiros"></a>History
During the Persian wars, Nisyros, along with Kalymnos and Kos, were subject to the Kingdom of
Bodrum under Artemisia. Then he followed the fate of the rest of the islands. It seems that
colonists from the island founded Nisyros in Caria of Asia Minor. It was captured by the
Italians in 1912, who ruled the island until its annexation to Greece in 1948.

#### <a name="volcano-nisiros"></a>Volcano of Nisiros
Nisyros, along with Methana, Milos and Santorini, is among the active volcanoes of our country.
 The oldest rocks of the island date back to 160,000 years while the newest (prehistoric) is
 15,000 years old and cover the whole island.\


Polybotis is the largest crater in the volcano, with a diameter of 260m and a depth of 30m.
There are five other craters in the area, the largest of which is "Stefanos", with a diameter
of 30 meters and a depth of 30 meters. Also, the volcano surrounds a valley (caldera), with a
length of 2,400m and a width of 950m.


Estimations show that two explosions occurred 25,000 years ago.The volcano erupted in 1422,
and four centuries later, in 1872, the eruption of the volcano caused earthquakes. Ash
and other materials covered the ground of Rammus. The territory of the Lakki and Rammos
areas had been transformed into a lake with warm, salt water, overflowing with the crater.
The most recent strong explosion occurred in 1888. A cylindrical conduit of volcanic
 elements with a diameter of at least 25 meters was created.

#### <a name="gen-info-Rhodes"></a>General Information
Rhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese islands of Greece and is also the island group's historical capital. Administratively the island forms a separate municipality within the Rhodes regional unit, which is part of the South Aegean administrative region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Rhodes. The city of Rhodes had 50,636 inhabitants in 2011.
It is located northeast of Crete, southeast of Athens and just off the Anatolian coast of Turkey. Rhodes' nickname is The island of the Knights, named after the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem, who once conquered the land.

#### <a name="history-Rhodes"></a>History
In the 8th century BC, the island's settlements started to form, with the coming of the Dorians, who built the three important cities of Lindos, Ialyssos and Kameiros, which together with Kos, Cnidus and Halicarnassus (on the mainland) made up the so-called Dorian Hexapolis
(Greek for six cities).

In Pindar's ode, the island was said to be born of the union of Helios the sun god and the nymph Rhodos, and the cities were named for their three sons. The rhoda is a pink hibiscus, native to the island. Diodorus Siculus added that Actis, one of the sons of Helios and Rhode, travelled to Egypt. He built the city of Heliopolis and taught the Egyptians astrology.

In the second half of the 8th century, the sanctuary of Athena received votive gifts that are markers for cultural contacts: small ivories from the Near East and bronze objects from Syria. At Kameiros on the northwest coast, a former Bronze Age site, where the temple was founded in the 8th century, there is another notable contemporaneous sequence of carved ivory figurines. The cemeteries of Kameiros and Ialyssos yielded several exquisite exemplars of the Orientalizing Rhodian jewellery, dated in the 7th and early 6th centuries BC.Phoenician presence on the island at Ialysos is attested in traditions recorded much later by Rhodian historians.

#### <a name="archaeology-Rhodes"></a>Archaeology
The Colossus of Rhodes was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This giant bronze statue was documented as once standing at the harbour. It was completed in 280 BC and destroyed in an earthquake in 224 BC. No trace of the statue remains today.

Historical sites on the island of Rhodes include the Acropolis of Lindos, the Acropolis of Rhodes with the Temple of Pythian Apollo and an ancient theatre and stadium, ancient Ialysos, ancient Kamiros, the Governor's Palace, Rhodes Old Town (walled medieval city), the Palace of the Grand Masters, Kahal Shalom Synagogue in the Jewish Quarter, the Archeological Museum, the ruins of the castle of Monolithos, the castle of Kritinia, St. Catherine Hospice and Rhodes Footbridge.

#### <a name="nightlife-Rhodes"></a>Nightlife
On an island of contrasts, Rhodes‚Äô nightlife can take you from lively and raucous to chilled and romantic in the space of a single evening. For sheer number and variety, Rhodes‚Äô nightclubs are the places to be seen, while plentiful tavernas and eateries leave you spoilt for choice too. Here‚Äôs our guide to Rhodes‚Äô four main locations and their evening hotspots.

<b>Faliraki:</b>
Rhodes nightlife doesn‚Äôt get better than this. Faliraki‚Äôs reputation as a 24-hour party town makes it the first stop for anyone looking to cut loose on this fascinating Greek island. With two strips of bars, clubs and restaurants to choose from, you can easily find a cosy restaurant corner, a sophisticated cocktail bar or a dance-till-dawn, strobe-lit club with resident DJ. Most people head to Bar Street for drinks before switching to Club Street for the best of Rhodes‚Äô nightclubs around 1am.

Ziggy‚Äôs on Bar Street is cocktail heaven and the place where the fishbowl was invented, so a great spot for a group photo. Once on Club Street, the Matrix garden lets clubbers clear their heads or cool off, while the Bed Club has all the big name DJs in the summer months. But leave time for the famous Q Club for great tunes and dancing till 5am.

<b>Rhodes Town:</b>
Less crowded but endlessly lively and fascinating, nightlife in Rhodes Town is laid back and relaxed. Make a beeline for the popular Hippocrates Square in the medieval old town, where bars, tavernas and eateries surround a pretty fountain in the shadow of the palace.

You‚Äôll love the centrally-located Ammoyiali Restaurant on Voriou Ipirou for its deliciously modern take on traditional Greek fare, while cocktails at Flaws Bar always means the best service in chicer than chic surroundings. Or, for a classic Greek taverna playing live, traditional music, head to Blue Lagoon and dance like the locals do.

<b>Pefkos and Lindos:</b>
Off the beaten track but adored by locals, the resorts of Lindos and Pefkos on the eastern shores of the island are both stunning and secluded. But don‚Äôt be fooled. While both villages are quiet and idyllic during daylight hours, they liven up considerably in the evening.

A surprise find in such a balmy location is Lindos Ice Bar on Krana Square. Partygoers seek out this refuge from the Grecian sunshine, donning big coats and huge smiles as they drink at an ice bar from glasses made from the same. The beats and light show are equally cool. Meanwhile, the Eclipse Bar in Pefkos attracts a young crowd with something for everyone, from pool and games to music and dancing, plus the only cliff-jumping waterfall in Greece.

Food-wise, you‚Äôll find some stunning locations for watching the sunset, while enjoying a glass of local wine and the catch of the day. Try Philosophia Beach Taverna In Pefkos for romantic views of the bay and a chance to dip your toes in the water. In a similar vein is Dapapa on Kavos Beach, where the seafood is glorious with a backdrop to match. Ambrosia Restaurant in Lindos is sheer foodie heaven. Call in after a day exploring the acropolis, for a family-friendly atmosphere and seafood you‚Äôll remember long after your tan fades.

  * <b>Xristos Rachwn</b> : The little gaulatic village. During the early hours you can't hear anything happening in the area. An informal rule says that the stores open after 9 in the night ,as the locals work in the morning cropping their fields. This custom is still going on and Raches is unofficially the heart of Ikaria.

  * <b>Mounte Monastery</b>: Is a female monastery established in the 13th century with really iconic old pictures. It is located close to Xristos Rachwn in a magnificent green area with amazing view. If it happens you visit this monastery it is worth trying the handmade treats of the nun.


  * <b>Koskina Castle</b>: It is located in the center of Ikaria. This castle is also named castle of Nikarias because once is was the most important fort of the island. Having a 10 minute walk you will see the main fort that the legend says it was occupied only once.

#### <a name="history_aegina"></a>Some History
Aegina dates back to 20th century BC, meaning that it has a large historical background to offer. At first, the island was a site of trade for people living in Attica and the Peloponnesus. Throughout the history, Aegina passed through a lot of wars and rivalries, especially with Athens. However, it was dominated by many different tribes, such as the Macedonians, the Achaeans etc. During the Byzantine period, Aegina belonged to the East Roman Empire in 395. The island flourished during the early 9th century, as evidenced by church construction activity, but suffered greatly from Arab raids originating from Crete. The first devastating hit for the island took place in 1654 during the Ottoman Empire. Almost 2 centuries later, during the Greek War of Independence, Aegina became an administrative centre for the Greek revolutionary authorities. That period, Ioannis Kapodistrias was briefly established on the island.

#### <a name="why_aegina"></a>Why Aegina?
Aegina belongs to the Saronic Gulf, a part of sea which is surrounded be Attica's urban area. All the islands of the Saronic gulf-Aegina, Salamis, Poros- are very close destinations for just a day-trip as the port of Piraeus, Athen's port, lies on the northeastern edge of the gulf. In combination with the beauty that Aegina offers, if you just came in Athens for a couple of days, don't hesitate to go to Piraeus, buy a ferry-boat ticket and travel to Aegina.

Beachlife on Marathonas starts at Greek Easter when the beach restaurants open for the first time. At the beginning of June, the entire beach is fully operating with all sunbeds and umbrellas in place. The beach season finishes at the end of October. It is a very busy beach and that's the reason why you need to arrive early in the morning. When the sky is clear, you can enjoy the view towards Moni island on your left with Methana behind it, and more in front you can see the island of Agistri with the Peloponnese in the background. In the autumn you can experience the most spectacular sunsets when the sun sets behind the island of Moni.

Akrogiali is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At night, Pavlos gives Akrogiali a very special romantic atmosphere by putting sometimes torches in the sea in front and having lots of candles on the tables. The perfect place for your romantic dinner at the beach, especially with full moon! From your table you can see the moonrise, coming out of the sea! You can even take a swim in the moonlight.

## <a name="evia_island"></a>Evia
The island of Evia is one of the closest to Athens and yet it is one of the most unknown. That is because Evia is so large that there is much to know about it. Second in size to Crete, it stretches from the tip of the Pelion Peninsula all the way south to the coast of Attika. It's southern tip is just a short distance from the Cycladic islands of Andros and Kea though unfortunately there is no ferry connection. If there were, more tourists would come here. As it is, because it is so close to the mainland that you can drive to it, Evia has been and remains a popular summer holiday destination for Greeks and Greek-Americans, Canadians, Australians and others whose families originally came from the island.The topography of the island is as varied as anywhere in Greece, with sparkling Aegean beaches and coves on its east coast, a mountainous interior with rivers, streams and forests, a west coast that is a mix of beaches, the city of Halkida, large towns, industry, agriculture, beaches and wetlands. And in the northwest the town of Edipsos is the most popular spa in Greece, with hot water gushing from rocks and crevices into the sea and pools of the many hotels and healing centers.There are several ways to reach Evia from Athens. Which way you choose depends on where in Evia you want to go, because as I said; Evia is a very large island and a very long one. How large and long? From one tip to the other could take you four or five hours by car.  You could drive almost to Thessaloniki from Athens in that time. Of course much of the journey will be on narrow winding roads where there is a good possibility that you will be stuck behind a big slow moving truck with nowhere to pass for at least part of the journey. And most likely you will stop to wade in the cool waters of the Kirea river that runs alongside the road that goes north from the modern city of Halkida to the fishing village of Limni, the spas of Edipsos and the beautiful beaches of the northern coast.

## <a name="crete_island"></a>Crete
Of all the Greek islands, Crete is one of the most distinctive and beautiful. Our guide lists great places to stay (from campsites to boutique hotels), the best tavernas and the island‚Äôs must sees.It is the largest Greek island, has the most diverse mix of landscapes, and stands far to the south of most of the rest of the country. Bits of it are reminiscent of other parts of Greece, but on the whole it stands alone and has its own unmistakeable culture and atmosphere.The north coast of the island is the most populated area, and most well known to tourists. Heraklion (or Iraklion) is the island‚Äôs capital and main entry point. A working city, it can be off-putting at first, but it has a world-class museum. Rethymnon and Hania to the west are much more pleasant and retain a distinct Venetian influence. To the east Agios Nikolaos, or Ag Nik to Brits, is one of the island‚Äôs major resort, but still retains some character.

The interior is home to the White Mountains, which soar to over 2,000m in the western part of the island, and offer some spectacular hikes and drives. The mountains are a bit more gentle to the east, and in their midst they hide the extraordinary basin of the Lasithi plateau dotted with white windmills.The south coast is much more rugged and less visited than the north. It is crisscrossed with gorges and dotted with isolated villages and coves. It is also the stepping off point for the isolated islets to the south of Crete.

The last thing that makes Crete stand out from the other islands is the breadth of its history: from the mysterious Minoans with their labyrinthine palaces, through Venetian control, to the daring deeds during the German occupation.
