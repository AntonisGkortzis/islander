How can you not like a beach that you can just relax under the shade of trees? Saint Nicholas is the number one place to go if you want to relax, listen to the sound of the waves and read your book.
* [Saint George Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189450-d11644964-Reviews-Agios_Georgios_Dysalona_Beach-Symi_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html)
Probably one of the most amazing sceneries in the island. No buildings, no trace of human contact with this amazing place. Shade is provided only by the giant cliff that stands above of the beach and its white color along with the turquoise color of the sea produces a breathtaking result.
