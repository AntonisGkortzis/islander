![](/images/cephalonia.jpg)
Cephalonia is the largest of the Ionian Islands. The sapphire waters of Cephalonia are steeped with history. Cephalonia is considered by many the home to Odysseus, the legendary king hailed in Homer‚Äôs The Odyssey. Fortunately, it won‚Äôt take you ten years to get there. Explore the enchanting caverns of the Drogarati caves, sail to Ithaca on a glass-bottomed boat or marvel at the ancient artifacts inside the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli, Cephalonia‚Äôs main town. Or just hide from it all at one of the island‚Äôs many private beach coves.

#### <a name="paxoiInfo"></a>Discover Paxoi
How about visiting the island that was first mentioned by the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets, Homer? Paxoi in Greek is actually in plural, due to the existence of an island chain including Antipaxoi (MUST visit!) which is located 5.5 miles far away from Paxoi. The central port of Paxoi is called Gaios, where you can find plenty of restaurants and cafeterias and enjoy the beautiful view.

Are you wondering how to get there? Every day, the ferry-boats of Igoumenitsa transfer a lot of tourists who aim to explore Paxoi. If you go to Igoumenitsa by car, bare in mind that you' d better use the new highway in order to "gain" time (2 hours). Unless you want to drive for 5 1/2 hours:frowning:!

If you are a fan of camping you can also try it in Antipaxoi. ![](/images/Antipaxoi.jpg)
**What else to see in Antipaxoi?**: After you finish your relaxing time at the beautiful beach of Antipaxoi you can retake the same small boat and visit the wonderful caves that are located in different spots around the island but are accessible only by boat. By the way, you can rent your own boat! ![](/images/antipaxoi-blue-caves-cruise.jpg)

#### <a name='swimPaxoi'></a>Where to swim
Excpet for the beaches you can reach by boat, in order to reach the most remarkable ones (of course, all beaches are beautiful) you need to take the car or use the local means of transport. Here are some of the most beautiful beaches you can find in Paxoi and Antipaxoi:

* [Vrika Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d2061955-Reviews-Vrika_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
One of the most beautiful beaches which is located in the north part of Antipaxoi is called Vrika Beach. The light-blue and green water can be easily visible when approaching the beach with the boat. The almost white sand in combination with the landscape and the clear sea will impress you. It is a well-organized beach where you can rent an umbrella and/or sunbeds and enjoy the hot summer days.
* [Monodendri Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189461-d7071058-Reviews-Monodendri_Beach-Paxos_Ionian_Islands.html):
If you are looking for a non-organized beach, Monodendri is your solution. Though unorganized, you can lay on the sand, swim safely and at 7 p.m. you can enjoy the wonderful sunset. At a glance you may face some difficulties on accessing Monodendri Beach, but in reality it is not that difficult and it is absolutely worth making an effort to reach this beach.

    The most famous beach of the island which you must visit if you pass by the island. The view to the iconic little church of Analipseos in the port is what makes the beach a must-visit.


#### <a name="sightseeing_ikaria"></a>Sightseeing

  * <b>Xristos Rachwn</b> : The little gaulatic village. During the early hours you can't hear anything happening in the area. An informal rule says that the stores open after 9 in the night ,as the locals work in the morning cropping their fields. This custom is still going on and Raches is unofficially the heart of Ikaria.

  * <b>Mounte Monastery</b>: Is a female monastery established in the 13th century with really iconic old pictures. It is located close to Xristos Rachwn in a magnificent green area with amazing view. If it happens you visit this monastery it is worth trying the handmade treats of the nun.


  * <b>Koskina Castle</b>: It is located in the center of Ikaria. This castle is also named castle of Nikarias because once is was the most important fort of the island. Having a 10 minute walk you will see the main fort that the legend says it was occupied only once.
