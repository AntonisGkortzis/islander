![](/images/cephalonia.jpg)
Cephalonia is the largest of the Ionian Islands. The sapphire waters of Cephalonia are steeped with history. Cephalonia is considered by many the home to Odysseus, the legendary king hailed in Homer‚Äôs The Odyssey. Fortunately, it won‚Äôt take you ten years to get there. Explore the enchanting caverns of the Drogarati caves, sail to Ithaca on a glass-bottomed boat or marvel at the ancient artifacts inside the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli, Cephalonia‚Äôs main town. Or just hide from it all at one of the island‚Äôs many private beach coves.

#### <a name="paksoiInfo"></a>Basic Info
How about visiting the island that was first mentioned by the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets, Homer? Paksoi in Greek is actually in plural, due to the existence of an island chain including Antipaksoi (MUST visit!) which is located 5.5 miles far away from Paksoi. The central port of Paksoi is called Gaios, where you can find plenty of restaurants and cafeterias and enjoy the beautiful view.

Are you wondering how to get there? Every day, the ferry-boats of Igoumenitsa transfer a lot of tourists who aim to explore Paksoi. If you go to Igoumenitsa by car, bare in mind that you'd better use the new highway in order to "gain" time (2 hours). Unless you want to drive for 5 1/2 hours:frowning:!

And it's beautiful. It is located under Pelopponese and the combination of the 3 open seas around it and the various influences from a wide variety of civilizations occupying it through the centuries ,has created a unique scenery. The island was a crossroad for merchants since the ancient times and also a fortress during wars due to its significant strategic position. The result of that reflects on the island's architecture, traditions and customs. Beside it's diversity, Kythira is also believed to be the island of Aphrodite,an ancient godess-protector of pure love. Due to that, during the modern days the island is believed to have an ability to create and maintain pure forever-lasting relationships for its occupants and visitors ,which is also the reason why many couples visit the island annually.

Antiparos is a small island of Cyclades, located just next to Paros island. Antiparos is a nice destination for one day excursion from Paros. Nudism and camping are particularly popular on these beaches. Chora, the capital and only village of Antiparos Greece, has traditional Cycladic architecture with narrow paved streets, whitewashed houses and lovely blue-domed churches. On the southern side, there is an impressive cave with stalactites and stalagmites.

#### <a name="discoverSymi"></a>Discover Symi
Symi is a small island located just 30 minutes by boat from Rhodes. It's a perfect destination for people who want to see the Greek way of life, get away from their daily routine and find themselves.

Are you bored of taking the car or the local buses to finally reach, after a long and hot journey, the beach? Well if the answer is yes look no further than Symi. You take the local boats and you can reach all beaches within a few minutes. Don't let the small size of the island fool you. There are some great and very different choices.
* [Nanou Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Attraction_Review-g189450-d7125012-Reviews-Nanou_Beach-Symi_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html):
Nanou is one of the largest beaches of Symi and it is definitely one of the most beautiful ones. Sunbeds and umbrellas are included so you will be able to stay there and relax the whole day. Want a snack or something to drink? Don't worry there is a restaurant just behind the beach.

Probably one of the most amazing sceneries in the island. No buildings, no trace of human contact with this amazing place. Shade is provided only by the giant cliff that stands above of the beach and its white colour along with the turquoise colour of the sea produces a breathtaking result.

#### <a name="eatSymi"></a>Where to eat
Symi despite being a very small island has a great variety of restaurants and can accommodate the needs of even the most demanding customers. You can find everything from gourmet restaurants and Italian places to seafood "tavernas" and souvlaki stores.

Who wouldn't want the most fresh fish you can find? The family that owns the restaurant go every morning to fish and later at noon you can go and see what they caught. A true and unique experience.
* [Meraklis](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/Restaurant_Review-g1188751-d2198368-Reviews-Taverna_Meraklis-Gialos_Symi_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html):
